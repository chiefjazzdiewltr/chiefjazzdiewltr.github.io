# Welcome to the backend of my Website

---

## Purpose of the Site

The purpose of this site is simply for me to display stuff people might want to know about me, and to bring myself back up to speed with coding and specifically web development.
For those that are here, feel free to (if needed) take and use snippets from here. I don't particularly care.

## Questions

If there happen to be any issues that I don't catch, or whatever then feel free to leave an issue on the Github.
